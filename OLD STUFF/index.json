            "description": "For a graduate class, I was the audio lead for a VR audio experience that involved an external client in Kyoto. I effectively worked a 9-5 with this job, balancing it with my other course-load. I handled the audio implemenation and editing such as, getting spatialization working for our flock and having said flock's sound changed depending on the distance between the player and the flock. I also worked with binarual beats, implementing them within Unity. I was given pre-set audio clips from our external client, sadly not able to make my own.",

I created two songs for the game, trying to focus more on fitting the theme instead of having a perfect song. I also made the sound effects, implemented the audio and made audio sliders in the menu. I had to manage the amount of time spent on this project, due to it being one of the four projects I made around this time, thus not being able to give it my 100%.",
