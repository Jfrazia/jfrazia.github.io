            "description": "For my graduate studio course, I was tasked with assisting with an undergraduate capstone project. This was a VR audio experience that had an external client in Kyoto that we worked with. I handled the audio implemenation and editing. More specifically, getting spatialization working for our flock and having said flock's sound changed depending on the distance between the player and the flock. I also worked with binarual beats, implementing them within Unity. I sadly do not have a way to access this project at the moment, but hopefully soon I can either have an exe or a link to the exhibit.",
